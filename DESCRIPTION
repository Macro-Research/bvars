Description: This package provides functions to estimate Bayesian Vector-
    Autoregressive models and compute Impulse-Response Functions. Currently included
    are VARs with Minnesota-Prior and independent Normal-Wishart Prior. It also
    includes a function to estimate a Threshold Vector Autoregression with an
    independent Normal-Wishart prior.
